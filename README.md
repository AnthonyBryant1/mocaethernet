<h1>Using MoCA 2.5 To Provide Ethernet Connections Using Existing Coax</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using a very under-rated piece of technology called MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance), which can utilize the existing coax wiring in a building, and convert that copper into ethernet wiring. You can cover long distances at high speeds, without having to drill holes. The MoCA 2.5 spec supports 2.5 Gbps throughput.
